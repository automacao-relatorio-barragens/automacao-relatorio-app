# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Available scripts

The project is configured with scripts to streamline development:

- `npm run lint` â€“ check code with ESLint.
- `npm run format` â€“ format files using Prettier.
- `npm test` â€“ run the test suite with Node's built-in test runner.
- `npm run test:e2e` â€“ execute end-to-end tests (placeholder).
- `npm run pdf:sample` â€“ generate a sample PDF file.

Committing changes triggers Husky and lint-staged to automatically lint, format, and test your work.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Development scripts

Run common project tasks:

```bash
pnpm test        # run unit tests
pnpm test:e2e    # run end-to-end tests
pnpm pdf:sample  # generate a sample report PDF
```

## Reporting feature

This app can generate PDF reports from structured form data. Each template defines a JSON schema, a field-to-coordinate mapping, and a base PDF. See [docs/reports/field-mapping.md](docs/reports/field-mapping.md) for field placement and [docs/reports/adding-new-report-template.md](docs/reports/adding-new-report-template.md) to create new templates.
